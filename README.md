# hello-base
my first public repo this repository is created to complete the base guild github commit task
public repo for base guild task

document base guild task setup and learnings
joined base guild and reviewed available tasks

goal is to complete tasks through public learning

-----------------
base guild requires public github commits

private repositories are not counted
created a public repository for task verification

focused on clean commit history
public visibility is mandatory for guild sync

verified repo is accessible without login

---------------------------
verification may not update instantly

patience and retry are sometimes required

commit email should match github account

public email improves detection reliability


commits can be frequent but should be meaningful

small changes are acceptable

clear commit titles help maintain readability

titles should describe the change briefly

------------------------

guild sync may take a few minutes

refreshing after some time helps

public work matters more than speed

consistency is key

base is an ethereum layer 2

focused on scalability and builders

base settles on ethereum

low fees improve developer experience

used for testing contracts

faucets provide test tokens

wallet needs base network added

testnet and mainnet differ

test tokens are for experimentation

not real value assets

focus on basics before advanced patterns

readability over complexity

contracts define state and behavior

functions modify or read state

common types include uint, address, bool

choosing correct types matters

public, external, internal, private

visibility affects security

understanding fundamentals reduces bugs

testing is essential

simplest contract structure

good starting point for learning

------------------------
compile, deploy, verify

use testnet first
remix is browser based

useful for quick experiments

gas optimization improves efficiency

unnecessary storage should be avoided

small mistakes are common

logs help debugging


tasks guide learning direction

clear objectives help focus

public repo

recent commits

correct account connected

---------------
retries are normal

avoid rushing changes

steady progress achieved

more tasks ahead

regular commits matter

learning compounds over time

public notes help others

accountability increases

visible proof of work

easier collaboration

folders improve navigation

names should be clear

simple language works best

avoid unnecessary jargon

markdown is lightweight

easy to read and write

official docs are primary source

community guides are helpful

adjust goals as needed

stay flexible

errors are learning opportunities

patience is required

repetition increases speed

clarity reduces mistakes

tasks completed so far documented

next steps planned

break tasks into small steps

avoid burnout

commits should explain intent

avoid vague messages

clean repos invite collaboration

documentation helps newcomers

focus on learning not farming

long term view matters

feedback improves quality

iteration is normal

mini apps simplify onchain UX

builder opportunity area

tools reduce friction

choose tools wisely

prioritize impactful tasks

track progress
----------------------

understanding improved significantly

confidence increased

50 commits reached

momentum maintained
