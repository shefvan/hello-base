# hello-base
my first public repo this repository is created to complete the base guild github commit task
public repo for base guild task

document base guild task setup and learnings
joined base guild and reviewed available tasks

goal is to complete tasks through public learning

-----------------
base guild requires public github commits

private repositories are not counted
created a public repository for task verification

focused on clean commit history
public visibility is mandatory for guild sync

verified repo is accessible without login

---------------------------
verification may not update instantly

patience and retry are sometimes required

commit email should match github account

public email improves detection reliability


commits can be frequent but should be meaningful

small changes are acceptable

clear commit titles help maintain readability

titles should describe the change briefly

------------------------

guild sync may take a few minutes

refreshing after some time helps

public work matters more than speed

consistency is key

base is an ethereum layer 2

focused on scalability and builders

base settles on ethereum

low fees improve developer experience

used for testing contracts

faucets provide test tokens

wallet needs base network added

testnet and mainnet differ

test tokens are for experimentation

not real value assets

focus on basics before advanced patterns

readability over complexity

contracts define state and behavior

functions modify or read state

common types include uint, address, bool

choosing correct types matters

public, external, internal, private

visibility affects security

understanding fundamentals reduces bugs

testing is essential

simplest contract structure

good starting point for learning
